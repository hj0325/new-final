This is a Next.js project set up to render 3D models using React, React Three Fiber, and Drei.

## Getting Started

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project Structure

- `pages/`: Contains the Next.js pages. `pages/index.js` is the main page that renders the 3D scene.
- `public/`: Store your static assets here, such as your `.gltf` models (e.g., `Body.gltf`, `Wings.gltf`).
- `package.json`: Lists project dependencies and scripts.
